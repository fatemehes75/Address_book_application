# Address Book Project
## Overview
This repository contains two versions of an address book application project implemented in Python, both utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. One version features a command-line interface (CLI), while the other incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## Features
### Common Features
- Encapsulation: Demonstrated strong OOP skills by organizing the project into encapsulated classes, including Contacts and AddressBookManager.
- Inheritance: Utilized inheritance to share common functionalities between different project parts, enhancing code reuse and maintainability.
- Polymorphism: Applied polymorphism to allow flexibility with different object types, making the code adaptable and extensible.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI) Version
- Implemented a modular address book application using a command-line interface for user interaction.
- Project Structure:
  * main_cli.py: Entry point for the command-line interface version.
  * address_book_manager.py: Class for managing the address book with CLI interactions.
  * Contact.py: Class defining the structure of contact objects.
  * data.py: Sample data for initializing the address book.
  
## Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version
- Designed a Tkinter-based GUI to enhance user experience, providing a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.
- Project Structure:
  * main_gui.py: Entry point for the Tkinter GUI version.
  * address_book_gui.py: Class handling the GUI interactions for the address book.
  * address_book_manager.py: Class managing the address book logic (common with CLI version).
  * Contact.py: Class defining the structure of contact objects (common with CLI version).
  * data.py: Sample data for initializing the address book (common with CLI version).
