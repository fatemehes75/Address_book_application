# Address Book Project
## Overview
This repository contains two versions of an address book application project implemented in Python, both utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. One version features a command-line interface (CLI), while the other incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

## Features
### Common Features
. Encapsulation: Demonstrated strong OOP skills by organizing the project into encapsulated classes, including Contacts and AddressBookManager.
. Inheritance: Utilized inheritance to share common functionalities between different parts of the project, enhancing code reuse and maintainability.
. Polymorphism: Applied polymorphism to allow flexibility with different object types, making the code adaptable and extensible.

Command-Line Interface (CLI) Version
Implemented a modular address book application using a command-line interface for user interaction.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version
Designed a Tkinter-based GUI to enhance user experience, providing a more intuitive and visually appealing interface.
